# Resume Review Context

## Perspective

When reviewing or updating this resume, evaluate it through the lens of a **top-tier technical recruiter** filling Staff+ engineering roles at high-growth companies.

## Key Evaluation Criteria

### What Recruiters Look For

1. **Impact over activity** - Did they move metrics? Enable business outcomes? Or just do their job?
2. **Scope and scale** - Team size, customer base, technical complexity, organizational reach
3. **Leadership signals** - Technical leadership (not management), cross-functional influence, organizational change
4. **Specificity** - Concrete numbers, named technologies, measurable outcomes
5. **Differentiation** - What makes this candidate unique? Why hire them over 50 other qualified candidates?

### Red Flags to Avoid

- Generic buzzwords without substance ("synergy", "cutting-edge", "world-class")
- Responsibilities listed instead of accomplishments
- Vague claims without evidence or metrics
- Resume longer than one page for <15 years experience
- Poor visual hierarchy or hard to scan

## Review Framework

When evaluating changes, ask:

1. **Would this make a hiring manager schedule an interview?**
2. **Does each bullet answer: So what? Why does this matter?**
3. **Can a non-expert understand the business value?**
4. **Is this the strongest possible framing of the accomplishment?**
5. **Does the resume tell a coherent story about career progression?**

## Staff+ Engineering Expectations

For Staff/Principal roles, recruiters specifically look for:

- **Force multiplication** - Did they enable others? Scale impact beyond themselves?
- **Technical strategy** - Architecture decisions, platform choices, long-term thinking
- **Organizational influence** - Cross-team initiatives, company-wide standards, stakeholder management
- **Execution under ambiguity** - Navigating complex problems without clear solutions
- **Business acumen** - Understanding how technical work enables business outcomes

## Writing Standards

- Lead with outcomes, explain technical approach second
- Use strong verbs: Built, Architected, Led, Established, Drove, Enabled
- Quantify everything: team size, scale, customers, metrics, time savings
- Be specific: "Fortune 50 financial services" not "large customers"
- One page, always

## Final Check

Before approving changes, ensure the resume passes the **"10-second test"**:
- Can a recruiter grasp the candidate's level and impact in 10 seconds?
- Do the most impressive accomplishments jump off the page?
- Is the value proposition immediately clear?
